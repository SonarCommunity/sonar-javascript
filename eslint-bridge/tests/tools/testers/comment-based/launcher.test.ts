/**
 * Comment-based Testing Framework Launcher
 *
 * This file provides a launcher for the Comment-based Testing Framework, which relies
 * on Jest and ESLint's rule tester. Basically, it tests the rule implementation of each
 * test file in the `fixtures` of the current folder. To do so, it read the file contents,
 * extracts from it the issue expectations, and use them as invalid test assertions with
 * ESLint's rule tester. To know which rule to test against a test file, the latter must
 * be named with the rule's name.
 *
 * @see package.json/ctest to test specific comment-based test files
