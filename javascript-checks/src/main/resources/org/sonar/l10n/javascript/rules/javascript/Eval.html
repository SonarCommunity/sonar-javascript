<p>Executing code dynamically is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9807">CVE-2017-9807</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9802">CVE-2017-9802</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>eval</code> function is a way to run arbitrary code at run-time. Dynamically evaluating code is slow and a potential security issue when
the arguments haven't been properly validated.</p>
<p>Any code which is dynamically evaluated in your process will have the same permissions as the rest of your code. Thus it is very dangerous to do so
with code coming from an untrusted source. <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Code_Injection">Injected Code</a> can either run on the server or
in the client (exemple: XSS attack).</p>
<p>This rule marks for review each occurence of dynamic code execution.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> the executed code may come from a untrusted source and hasn't been sanitized. </li>
  <li> the code to run is dynamically chosen via reflection, and an untrusted source can use it to choose which code to run. For example a class could
  be retrieved by its name and this name comes from a user input. </li>
</ul>
<p>You are at risk if you answered yes to any of these questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Regarding the execution of unknown code, the best solution is to not run code provided by an untrusted source. If you really need to do it, run the
code in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandboxed</a> environment. Use jails, firewalls and whatever means your
operating system and programming language provide (example: <a
href="https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/SEC54-J.+Create+a+secure+sandbox+using+a+security+manager">Security Managers</a> in java, <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_sandbox.asp">iframes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">same-origin
policy</a> for javascript in a web browser).</p>
<p>Do not try to create a blacklist of dangerous code. It is impossible to cover all attacks that way.</p>
<p>As for the use of reflection, it should be strictly controlled as it can lead to many vulnerabilities. Never let an untrusted source decide what
code to run. If you have to do it anyway, create a list of allowed code and choose among this list.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
var value = eval('obj.' + propName); // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
var value = obj[propName];
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>This rule will not raise an issue when the argument of the <code>eval</code> call is a literal string as it is reasonably safe.</p>
