<p>The fact that JavaScript is not a strongly typed language allows developers a lot of freedom, but that freedom can turn into giving you enough rope
to hang yourself. </p>
<p>Specifically, it is syntactically acceptable to invoke any expression as though its value were a function. But a <code>TypeError</code> may be
raised if you do.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
foo = 1;
foo();   // Noncompliant; TypeError

foo = undefined;
foo();  // Noncompliant; TypeError
</pre>
