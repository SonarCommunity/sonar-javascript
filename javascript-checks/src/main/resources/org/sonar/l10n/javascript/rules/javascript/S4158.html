<p>When a collection is empty it makes no sense to access or iterate it. Doing so anyway is surely an error; either population was accidentally
omitted or the developer doesn't understand the situation.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when any use is made of an empty collection other than the following ignored calls: <code>add</code>,
<code>addAll</code>, <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code>.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
List&lt;String&gt; strings = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

strings.remove("bar");  // Noncompliant
if (strings.contains("foo")) {}  // Noncompliant

for (String str : strings) {}  // Noncompliant
</pre>
