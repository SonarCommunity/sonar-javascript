<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Storing a value inside a collection at a given key or index and then unconditionally overwriting it without reading the initial value is a case of
"dead store".</p>
<p>This rule detects repeatedly adding an element at the same index or key in a collection or adding identical elements to a set.</p>
<pre>
 fruits[1] = "banana";
 fruits[1] = "apple";  // Noncompliant

 myMap.set("key", 1);
 myMap.set("key", 2); // Noncompliant

 mySet.add(1);
 mySet.add(1); // Noncompliant
</pre>
<p>At best it is redundant and will confuse the reader, most often it is an error and not what the developer intended to do.</p>
