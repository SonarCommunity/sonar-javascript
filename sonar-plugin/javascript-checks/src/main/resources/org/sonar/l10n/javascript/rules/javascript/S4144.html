<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>When two functions have the same implementation, either it was a mistake - something else was intended - or the duplication was intentional, but
may be confusing to maintainers. In the latter case, the code should be refactored.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
function calculateCode() {
  doTheThing();
  doOtherThing();
  return code;
}

function getName() {  // Noncompliant
  doTheThing();
  doOtherThing();
  return code;
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
function calculateCode() {
  doTheThing();
  doOtherThing();
  return code;
}

function getName() {
  return calculateCode();
}
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Functions with fewer than 3 lines are ignored. </li>
  <li> This rule does not apply to function expressions and arrow functions because they donâ€™t have explicit names and are often used in a way where
  refactoring is not applicable. </li>
</ul>
<pre>
list.map((item) =&gt; ({
  name: item.name,
  address: item.address,
  country: item.country
}));
</pre>
