<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>When an already-defined variable is given the same name within a new object, object-shorthand syntax is preferred as being more compact. Similarly,
object-shorthand is also preferred for the definition of functions in object literals.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
let a = 1;

let myObj = {
  a : a,  // Noncompliant
  fun: function () {  // Noncompliant
    //...
  }
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
let a = 1;

let myObj = {
  a,
  fun () {
    //...
  }
}
</pre>
