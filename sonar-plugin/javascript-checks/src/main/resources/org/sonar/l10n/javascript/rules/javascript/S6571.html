<p>In unions and intersections, redundant types should not be used.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>When creating a union or intersection of types in TypeScript, it is possible for certain constituents to clash with one another. For instance, if
the type <code>any</code> is included in a union, it takes precedence over all other constituents and causes the union to become the most generic
type, which is <code>any</code>. Similarly, if a type that is more restrictive than another type, like <code>1</code> for <code>number</code>, is
included in an intersection, it will take precedence over the other type and override it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some types do not have any impact when they are included in a union or intersection, like <code>never</code> in a union or
<code>unknown</code> in an intersection.</p>
<p>Eliminating any superfluous or overridden types from a union or intersection type can simplify the code and enhance its readability. Moreover, it
will provide a clearer representation of the actual values that a variable is capable of holding.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>The redundant and overridden types should be removed.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
type UnionWithAny = any | 'redundant'; // Noncompliant
type UnionWithNever = never | 'override'; // Noncompliant
type UnionWithLiteral = number | 1; // Noncompliant

type IntersectionWithAny = any &amp; 'redundant'; // Noncompliant
type IntersectionWithUnknown = string &amp; unknown; // Noncompliant
type IntersectionWithLiteral = string &amp; 'override'; // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
type UnionWithAny = any;
type UnionWithNever = never;
type UnionWithLiteral = number;

type IntersectionWithAny = any;
type IntersectionWithUnknown = string;
type IntersectionWithLiteral = 'override';
</pre>
