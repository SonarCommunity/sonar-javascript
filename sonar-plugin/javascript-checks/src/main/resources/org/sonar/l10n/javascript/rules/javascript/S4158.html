<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>When a collection is empty it makes no sense to access or iterate it. Doing so anyway is surely an error; either population was accidentally
omitted or the developer doesnâ€™t understand the situation.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
let strings = [];

if (strings.includes("foo")) {}  // Noncompliant

for (str of strings) {}  // Noncompliant

strings.forEach(str =&gt; doSomething(str)); // Noncompliant
</pre>
