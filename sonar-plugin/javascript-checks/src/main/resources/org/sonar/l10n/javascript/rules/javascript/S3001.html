<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The semantics of the <code>delete</code> operator are a bit tricky, and it can only be reliably used to remove properties from objects. Pass
anything else to it, and you may or may not get the desired result.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
var x  = 1;
delete x;       // Noncompliant

function foo(){
..
}

delete foo;  // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
var obj = {
  x:1,
  foo: function(){
  ...
  }
};
delete obj.x;
delete obj.foo;
</pre>
