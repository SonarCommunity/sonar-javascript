<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Many of JavaScriptâ€™s <code>Array</code> methods return an altered version of the array while leaving the source array intact. <code>reverse</code>
and <code>sort</code> do not fall into this category. Instead, they alter the source array <em>in addition to</em> returning the altered version,
which is likely not what was intended.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when the return values of these methods are assigned, which could lead maintainers to overlook the fact that the original
value is altered.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
const reversed = a.reverse(); // Noncompliant
const sorted = b.sort(); // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
const reversed = [...a].reverse();  // spread the contents of 'a' into a new array, so reverse doesn't impact 'a'
const reversed2 = a.toReversed(); // ES2023 method that copies and reverses the array
a.reverse(); // reverse the array in place

const sorted = [...b].sort(); // spread the contents of 'b' into a new array, so sort doesn't impact 'b'
const sorted2 = b.toSorted(); // ES2023 method that copies and sorts the array
b.sort(); // sort the array in place
</pre>
