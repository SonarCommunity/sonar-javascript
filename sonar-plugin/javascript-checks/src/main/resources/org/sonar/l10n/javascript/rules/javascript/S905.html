<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Any statement (other than a null statement, which means a statement containing only a semicolon <code>;</code>) which has no side effect and does
not result in a change of control flow will normally indicate a programming error, and therefore should be refactored.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
a == 1; // Noncompliant; was assignment intended?
var msg = "Hello, "
  "World!"; // Noncompliant; have we forgotten '+' operator on previous line?
</pre>
