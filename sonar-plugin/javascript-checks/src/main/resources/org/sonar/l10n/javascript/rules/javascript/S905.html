<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>When writing code, it is important to ensure that each statement serves a purpose and contributes to the overall functionality of the program. When
they have no side effects or do not change the control flow, they can either indicate a programming error or be redundant:</p>
<ol>
  <li> The code does not behave as intended: The statements are expected to have an effect but they do not. This can be caused by mistyping,
  copy-and-paste errors, etc. </li>
  <li> The statements are residual after a refactoring. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The rule does not raise an issue:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Statements containing only a semicolon (<code>;</code>) </li>
</ul>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
a == 1; // Noncompliant; was assignment intended?
var msg = "Hello, "
  "World!"; // Noncompliant; have we forgotten '+' operator on previous line?
</pre>
